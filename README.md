# DIVA Mobile Application Security Assessment

## Project Overview
Conducted a comprehensive **white-box penetration test** of the DIVA (Damn Insecure and Vulnerable Application) Android application to identify and document critical security flaws. The assessment followed the **OWASP Mobile Security methodology**, simulating real-world attack techniques to evaluate the application's defensive posture.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Android Studio** – Application analysis and testing  
- **Genymotion** – Android emulator environment  
- **MobSF (Mobile Security Framework)** – Automated vulnerability scanning  
- **JADX-GUI** – Decompilation and source code review  
- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** – Device interaction for manual testing  

## My Role / Responsibilities
- Conducted static and dynamic analysis of the application  
- Identified and documented vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Insecure Data Storage  
- Generated technical reports with remediation guidance and industry best practices  

## Key Achievements
- Found **8 critical and high-severity vulnerabilities**  
- Successfully demonstrated PoC exploits on sensitive data leakage and unauthorized activity  
- Provided actionable recommendations to mitigate risks
